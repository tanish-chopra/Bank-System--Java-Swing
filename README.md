# BankSystem

A small Java-based bank system example with a server and client and simple login/register GUI pages. This repository contains the sources and project files (Ant/NetBeans) for building and running the server and client locally.

## Highlights

- Minimal Java bank server + client sample
- Basic login and registration GUI forms (NetBeans form files included)
- Easy to build with NetBeans (Ant) or manually via javac/java

## Repository contents

- `src/` — Java sources and NetBeans form files
  - `BankServer.java` — TCP-based server entrypoint
  - `BankClient.java` — Client application entrypoint
  - `loginPage.java`, `loginPage.form` — Login GUI
  - `register.java`, `register.form` — Registration GUI
- `build.xml` — Ant build file (generated by NetBeans)
- `nbproject/` — NetBeans project metadata
- `build/` — build output (generated)

> Note: Files are in the default package (no package statement). Keep this in mind if integrating into a larger codebase.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed and available on PATH
- Optional: Apache Ant (for `ant` builds) and NetBeans (project files included)

## Database (MySQL Workbench)

This project can be used with a MySQL database for storing user accounts and balances. The following instructions describe how to set up a local MySQL database using MySQL Workbench and how to connect the Java application using MySQL Connector/J (the JDBC driver).

1) Create the database and table (use MySQL Workbench or the mysql CLI). Run the SQL below in MySQL Workbench's SQL editor:

```sql
-- create a database for this project
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS banksystem CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
USE banksystem;

-- a simple users table for demonstration (do NOT store plain passwords in production)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  balance DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- example test user (replace password_hash with your hashed password)
INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, balance) VALUES ('alice', 'REPLACE_WITH_HASHED_PASSWORD', 1000.00);
```

2) MySQL Workbench: create a connection to `localhost:3306` (or the host/port you use). Test the connection and run the SQL script above.

3) Java / JDBC notes

- Download MySQL Connector/J (Connector/J) from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ and place the JAR into a `lib/` folder at the project root (for example: `lib/mysql-connector-java-8.x.y.jar`).
- Update your code or configuration to use a JDBC URL like:

- Note: this project already includes a connector JAR in the project root named `mysql-connector-j-9.2.0.jar`. You can use that file directly or move it into a `lib/` folder if you prefer to keep third-party libraries in one place.

```
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/banksystem?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
```

- Example compile/run commands (PowerShell). Replace the connector filename with the one you downloaded:

```powershell
# create lib folder if you don't have one
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path .\lib

# compile (include connector on classpath if your sources import JDBC types)
javac -cp ".\lib\mysql-connector-java-8.x.y.jar" -d .\build\classes .\src\*.java

# run the server (include both classes and connector on classpath)
java -cp ".\build\classes;.\lib\mysql-connector-java-8.x.y.jar" BankServer

# run the client in another terminal
java -cp ".\build\classes;.\lib\mysql-connector-java-8.x.y.jar" BankClient
```

Notes:
- If your `BankServer` or `BankClient` source doesn't yet use JDBC, you can still follow these steps later when adding database support.
- Use secure password handling: store only password hashes (bcrypt/argon2) and never plain-text passwords. The example table uses a `password_hash` column—replace sample placeholder values with real hashes before using.
- If you prefer to package the connector into an executable JAR, adjust your Ant build (or IDE settings) to include the connector JAR on the runtime classpath.

## Quick start — Run locally (PowerShell)

Recommended: run the server first, then one or more clients.

1) Create output directory for compiled classes (if missing):

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path .\build\classes
```

2) Compile all Java sources into `build/classes`:

```powershell
javac -d .\build\classes .\src\*.java
```

3) Run the server (in one terminal):

```powershell
java -cp .\build\classes BankServer
```

4) Run a client (in another terminal):

```powershell
java -cp .\build\classes BankClient
```

If your environment or the project uses NetBeans, you can also open the `BankSystem` folder in NetBeans and run the project from the IDE. NetBeans will handle compilation and running.

### Build with Ant (optional)

If you have Ant installed, you can try building the project using the provided `build.xml`:

```powershell
# From the project root (where build.xml is located):
ant
# Or to create the jar (if the build.xml has a jar target):
ant jar
```

If `ant` is not on PATH on Windows, download Ant and add it to PATH or use NetBeans to build.

## How it works — short overview

- `BankServer` listens for client connections and processes basic bank-like requests.
- `BankClient` connects to the server and provides a UI for login/registration and basic actions.
- The `loginPage` and `register` forms are NetBeans GUI builder artifacts (`*.form`) alongside their Java backing classes.

## Common issues & troubleshooting

- "NoClassDefFoundError" or "Could not find or load main class": make sure you compiled sources into the `build/classes` directory and use `-cp .\build\classes` when launching `java`.
- If you move classes into packages, update the folder structure under `src/` and recompile with `javac -d`.
- If NetBeans-generated form code is modified manually, NetBeans may overwrite changes when saving the form in the designer.

## File map (what to look at first)

1. `src/BankServer.java` — server main class
2. `src/BankClient.java` — client main class
3. `src/loginPage.java` and `src/register.java` — UI classes
